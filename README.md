**Online video game store - Database Project**

Steam is an application whose characteristic functionality is to be a virtual video game store for PC (personal computer) users. It was born in 2003 and from there it began to become what is now known as the most popular online video game store in the world. the world.
The objective of the project is to replicate the basic functionalities and characteristics that the Steam database would have. Seeking that the final replica of said database is as close to the essence of the application as possible.

The project has the following: 
- Database code in SQL and its required explanations so that it can be replicated in a good way 
- Technical document with the development process and the initial and evolutionary approaches of the project
- Paper in IEEE format that describes and shows the user the final project
- Poster, which allows the user to see the essentials of the project as a summary
And all the additional documentation for the proper understanding of the entire database.


**Steps for replication to another device**

For now use db_stim.sql, you have to install postgres and dbaver, 
then they create a connection with postgres, 
Create a new database with the name db_stim and then right click on the database, tools, 
restore backup and there select the db_stim.sql file,
With that they would have the database and in the base.py file there is an example of how it connects with python.
